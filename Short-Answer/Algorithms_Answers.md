#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)  O(n) - while loop is not nested


b) O(nlogn) - j is incremented by multiplication by 2


c) O(n) - it is a recursive O(n) loop

## Exercise II

Throw the egg from lowest floor to see if the egg gets broken. 

When egg gets broken, we know this is the floor that egg starts getting broken. Egg doesn't break in all floors below.

Runtime complexity - O(n) complexity because it loops through every floors until a match is found
